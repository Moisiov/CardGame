{1} of a kind

Game board contains {0} decks ({1}x{1} grid)
of 52 cards. Players take turns to draw a new
card from any deck, except the last deck drawn.

When {1} cards with same value are on the
line horizontally, vertically or diagonally,
the player who drew the last card gets points
equal to the value of the drawn card. The
cards in the line are removed from decks and
new cards are drawn. If new line/lines appear,
player on turn gets points, cards are removed
and new cards are drawn. This is continued
until no lines are found.

The player who first gets {2} points or
above wins. If any of the decks run out of
cards, game ends and the winner is the player
with most points.
